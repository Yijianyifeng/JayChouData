Tornado:
Love is like a gust of wind, after it blows, it's gone
Such rhythm, no one can do anything about
Without you, my soul is out of control
Dark clouds descend, I'm dragged along by them
Quietly and silently leaving
Falling into the edge of danger, Baby
My world is now a stormy tempest, Wu
Love comes too fast, just like a tornado
Can't escape the storm, no time to run
I can't think anymore, I can't think anymore
I can't, I can't, I can't
Love leaves too fast, just like a tornado
Can't bear it, I've nowhere to hide
I don't want to think anymore, I don't want to think anymore
I don't, I don't, I don't want to think about you
Unconsciously, you've left me
Unconsciously, I followed the rhythm
Realizing too late, another autumn has passed
Realizing too late, I should live well
Quietly and silently leaving
Falling into the edge of danger, Baby
My world is now a stormy tempest, Wu
Love comes too fast, just like a tornado
Can't escape the storm, no time to run
I can't think anymore, I can't think anymore
I can't, I can't, I can't
Love leaves too fast, just like a tornado
Can't bear it, I've nowhere to hide
I don't want to think anymore, I don't want to think anymore
I don't, I don't, I don't want to think about you~
Oh~ Yeah~ Oh~
Love comes too fast, just like a tornado
Can't escape the storm, no time to run
I can't think anymore, I can't think anymore
I can't, I can't, I can't
Love leaves too fast, just like a tornado
Can't bear it, I've nowhere to hide
I don't want to think anymore, I don't want to think anymore
I don't, I don't, I don't want to think about you~
Unconsciously, you've left me
Unconsciously, I followed the rhythm
Realizing too late, another autumn has passed
Realizing too late, I should live well
Unconsciously, you've left me
Unconsciously, I followed the rhythm
Realizing too late, another autumn has passed
Realizing too late, I should live well
Unconsciously, you've left me
Unconsciously, I followed the rhythm
Realizing too late, realizing too late

Silence:
Only the piano stays with me, playing all day
The sleeping cello, quietly old
I think you've made it very clear
I understand, I also know, you're not reluctant to leave
You say you would feel sad, I don't believe it
Holding you, being with me, was just in the past
I hope he truly loves you more than I do
Only then can I force myself to leave
You want me to say how embarrassing, I really don't want to part
Why do I still have to smile through it all
I don't have the talent, to tolerate you and accept him
Don't worry too much, I'll keep on living well
You've already gone far away, I'll also slowly walk away
Why do I even accommodate you in our separation
I really don't have the talent, to quietly not be so quick
I'll learn to give you up, because I love you too much

Back to the past:
An old, yellow lamp, time silently stands by
Loneliness acts without restraint, not knowing the weight of its touch
Silence leaps over the unfamiliar, quietly watching from dawn to dusk
Your figure loses balance, slowly sinking
Darkness circles in the air, I can't see where to go
Perhaps love is on the other end of a dream
Unable to survive in the realm of reality
Wanting to return to the past, trying to hold you in my arms
Your shy face with a hint of childishness
Want to see the world you see, want to be in the scenes of your dreams
Just being close together can feel sweet
Wanting to return to the past, trying to let the story continue
At least not to let you leave me again
Distracting the attention of time, this time I will hold tighter
Wondering if it's still possible to retain, wanting to return to the past
Thoughts continuously block the playback of memories
Blind pursuit still ends up empty
The gloomy night hides sleep, where to find it I do not know
Turn around and loneliness lies beside
Wanting to return to the past, trying to hold you in my arms
Your shy face with a hint of childishness
Want to see the world you see, want to be in the scenes of your dreams
Just being close together can feel sweet
Wanting to return to the past, trying to let the story continue
At least not to let you leave me again
Distracting the attention of time, this time I will hold tighter
Wondering if it's still possible to retain, wanting to return to the past
Silence leaps over the unfamiliar, quietly watching from dawn to dusk
Your figure loses balance, slowly sinking
Wanting to return to the past

Sunny Day:
The story's little yellow flower
Has been floating since the year of birth
The childhood swing
Swings along with memories all the way to now
Re So So Si Do Si La
So La Si Si Si Si La Si La So
Blowing the prelude, looking at the sky
I remember the petals trying to fall
The day I skipped class for you, the day the flowers fell
That classroom, why can't I see it
The vanished rainy day, I really want to experience it again
Unexpectedly, the courage I lost, I still have
Really want to ask again, will you wait or leave
On the windy day, I tried holding your hand
But the rain gradually got so heavy that I lost sight of you
How much longer until I can be by your side
Maybe I'll be a little better on the day it clears
Once upon a time, there was someone who loved you for a long time
But the wind gradually blew the distance so far away
With much difficulty, we could love for one more day
But at the end of the story, you seemed to say goodbye

Trace:
How to hide my sorrow, the place where I lost you
Your hair fragrance disperses hastily, I can no longer keep up
Closing my eyes, I can still see the traces of you leaving
Under the moonlight, constantly searching for that missed figure
If saying goodbye is the starting point of pain
Then before the end, I'm willing to love once more
The love I want to tell you but dare not say
Will there be anyone who can understand?
I will stare blankly then forget you, then tightly close my eyes
Thinking of the day someone will replace you, so I no longer miss you
I will stare blankly then smile slightly, then tightly close my eyes
Thinking again of your gentle face, before I forget
Tears in my heart blur my vision, you're almost out of sight
Closing my eyes, I can still see the traces of you leaving under the moonlight 
Constantly searching for that missed figure
If saying goodbye is the starting point of pain
Then before the end, I'm willing to love once more
The love I want to tell you but dare not say
Will there be anyone who can understand?
I will stare blankly then forget you, then tightly close my eyes
Thinking of the day someone will replace you, so I no longer miss you

Thinking of the day someone will replace you, so I no longer miss you
I will stare blankly then smile slightly, then tightly close my eyes
Thinking again of your gentle face, before I forget
Tears in my heart blur my vision, I'm almost unable to see

Qilixiang:
The sparrows outside the window chatter on the telephone poles
You say this sentence has the feel of summer
The pencil in my hand moves back and forth on the paper
With a few lines, I describe you as my significant other
The taste of saury, both the cat and you wish to understand
The fragrance of first love, just like that, we found again
That warm sunshine, like freshly picked bright strawberries
You say you can't bear to eat and lose this feeling
The rain falls all night, my love overflows like the rainwater
The fallen leaves in the yard, a thick stack like my longing
A few words of right and wrong can't cool down my passion
You appear on every page of my poetry
The rain falls all night, my love overflows like the rainwater
The butterflies on the windowsill, like the beautiful chapters fluttering in poetry
I continue to write, inscribing my eternal love for you at the end of the poem
You are the only one I want to understand
The rain falls all night, my love overflows like the rainwater
The fallen leaves in the yard, a thick stack like my longing
A few words of right and wrong can't cool down my passion
You appear on every page of my poetry
The full ears of rice bring happiness to this season
And your cheeks, like ripe tomatoes in the field
Suddenly, you tell me the name "Seven Mile Fragrance" is beautiful
At this moment, I just want to kiss your stubborn lips
The rain falls all night, my love overflows like the rainwater
The fallen leaves in the yard, a thick stack like my longing
A few words of right and wrong can't cool down my passion
You appear on every page of my poetry
All night, my love overflows like the rainwater
The butterflies on the windowsill, like the beautiful chapters fluttering in poetry
I continue to write, inscribing my eternal love for you at the end of the poem
You are the only one I want to understand

Wind:
Dark clouds cast a shadow in our hearts
I listen to the long-silenced emotions
Clear and transparent, like a beautiful scenery
Always clearer in the memories
Can a heart, wounded through, continue to love me?
I forcefully hold up the cold hands
Past tenderness is locked by time
Only the sorrow that can't be dispersed remains
Slowly falling maple leaves are like yearning
I light a candle to warm the late autumn
The aurora plunders the edge of the sky
The north wind sweeps over your face in my thoughts
I turn my love into falling leaves
But can't exchange them for that familiar face
Slowly falling maple leaves are like yearning
Why must salvaging it be rushed before winter arrives
Loving you through time
Two lines of tears from the end of autumn
Letting love permeate the ground
All I want is just for you to be by my side
Can a heart, wounded through, continue to love me?
I forcefully hold up the cold hands
Past tenderness is locked by time
Only the sorrow that can't be dispersed remains
The elegant red rain fluttering midway up the mountain
With the north wind withering, I gently sway the wind chimes
Wishing to awaken the abandoned love
Snow has already covered the ground
Fearing the maple leaves outside the window have turned into ice
Slowly falling maple leaves are like yearning
I light a candle to warm the late autumn
The aurora plunders the edge of the sky
The north wind sweeps over your face in my thoughts
I turn my love into falling leaves
But can't exchange them for that familiar face
Slowly falling maple leaves are like yearning
Why must salvaging it be rushed before winter arrives
Loving you through time
Two lines of tears from the end of autumn
Letting love permeate the ground
All I want is just for you to be by my side

Walking back:
The sky is grey as if it has cried,
After leaving you, I didn't gain more freedom.
The sour air smells of our distance,
A heart-piercing ending, like breathing, can't be stopped.
The drawer's yellowed diary, squeezed dry of memories,
That smile is summer, our past forgotten with the clockwise turn.
Love after suffocation, careless tears are superfluous.
I know neither of us is wrong, just forgot how to step back,
Swore promises with conviction, yet were empty-handed with time.
I know we are not wrong, just letting go will make it easier,
The most beautiful love continues in memories.

Blue and white porcelain:
The unadorned draft sketches out, with the ink from a blue-and-white brush becoming lighter from dark,
The peony on the vase painted as your initial makeup.
The gradually rising sandalwood scent through the window, I understand your unspoken thoughts,
The writing on the xuan paper stops halfway.
The glaze color renders the painting of the lady, its charm secretly kept,
And your smile, shy as a bud waiting to bloom.
Your beauty, a strand that drifts away,
To places I cannot reach.
The azure sky awaits the misty rain, and I wait for you,
Smoke from cooking fires spirals up, across thousands of miles of river.
At the bottom of the vase, Han dynasty script is imitated, capturing the elegance of a bygone era,
As if I laid down my pen in preparation for meeting you.
The azure sky awaits the misty rain, and I wait for you,
The moonlight, scooped up, blurs the ending,
Like the heirloom blue-and-white porcelain, beautiful in its own right,
Your eyes carry a smile.
The color white and blue-green koi fish leap at the bottom of the bowl,
When I sign in Song dynasty style, my thoughts linger on you.
You hide within the kiln's thousand-year secret,
Exquisite as a needle from embroidery touching the ground.
Outside the curtain, the banana plant stirs the sudden rain, the door knocker induces verdigris,
And as I pass by that small town in the south of the Yangtze, I provoked your attention.
In the ink wash landscape,
You are hidden deep within the shades of ink.
The azure sky awaits the misty rain, and I wait for you,
Smoke from cooking fires spirals up, across thousands of miles of river.
At the bottom of the vase, Han dynasty script is imitated, capturing the elegance of a bygone era,
As if I laid down my pen in preparation for meeting you.

The promised love:
Your responses are scattered, at this moment,
I remember the white doves by the fountain, sweetness scattered.
Emotions inexplicably pulling, I still love you,
While you sing your song in bits and pieces, pretending it's all okay.
Time has passed, moved on, love faces choices, you've grown cold, tired, I've cried,
The unhappiness at leaving, you wrote by hand on a card, some loves only go so far, it truly hurts.
What's wrong? You're tired, where's the promised happiness?
I understand now, won't say anymore, love has faded, dreams are far away,
Counting each happiness and unhappiness, you're reluctant to let go,
Those feelings of love were too profound, I still remember them all.
You're not waiting anymore, where's the promised happiness?
I was wrong, tears have dried, letting go, filled with regret,
But the music box of memories still spins, how do we stop it?

Goodbye:
The weather turned cold, the rain fell, you left,
It's clear now, the one I loved is lost.
Fallen leaves float on the lake, fallen into sleep,
I want to let go, but can't, as the tears drift.
You see, you can't see,
I pretend the past doesn't matter,
Yet I find myself unable to do so.
After saying goodbye, I realized I will never see you again,
I can't just lose your smile like this.
Your lipstick remains on the corner of the table, but I can't find you,
If we switch roles, would you say it's okay?
After saying goodbye, I realized I will never see you again,
Can we just bear the pain, and not let the tears fall?
We promised to be together till old age, where do we find eternity now?
A hug once more, every minute, every second, would be nice.

Your laugh, your goodness, keep circling in my mind,
My hands, can't forget the warmth of yours,
My heart shattered, unable to pick up the past heartbeats,
Trapped in the past, I have no strength to escape.
After saying goodbye, I realized I will never see you again,
Can we just bear the pain, and not let the tears fall?
We promised to be together till old age, where do we find eternity now?

Mine_Mine:
Living without you, I've started writing novels,
So many scenes, so much inspiration, I want to give all the royalties to you.
Accidentally passing by the alley, your car still parked on the red line, I pay your fine.
You told me to not bother, that's when I remembered we've already parted ways.
Recalling that summer, no, it was actually winter,
Remembering your angry face, every day felt like winter, sigh sigh sigh.
You said it was love, love, love.
Who should be the strong one, the moon or the sun? Who overshadows whom, who relies on whom?
You said we've parted, why then should I still hold an umbrella for you?
Cuz baby you are mine, mine (Mine....)
Mine, mine (Mine....)
Too quickly, I admit I really miss you,
Wondering if it lacks masculinity, you say,
Bye bye (Bye....) Oh bye bye (Bye....)
Open up, my heart for you to see, filled entirely with love.
My eyelid twitches, it means you're thinking of me,
My ear itches, it means you're speaking ill of me,
I can't be that bad, no need to tell your friends, right? If we reconcile later, won't it be awkward seeing your friends?
Recalling that summer, no, it was actually winter,
Remembering your angry face, every day felt like winter, sigh sigh sigh.
You said it was love, love, love.
Who are we kidding? I take back all the harsh words I said,
The novel I wrote is just a blank night.
You said since we've parted, why still hold an umbrella for you?
Don't just sneak away,
Don't just sneak away,
Don't be surprised, I won't let you face it alone, you hoped for someone to rely on, someone to care,
Open up your umbrella quickly,
Open up your umbrella quickly,
Don't fret, in the heavy rain, getting drenched is tough, without you, the heavy rain is tough,
It will be tough...

Clearly:
The candy jar is full of colors,
But the smiles are no longer sweet.
Some of your happiness
Exists in moments without me.
In a medieval city,
I guess this is where I stop.
Seagulls no longer cling to the sea,
They can fly further away.
The distant sound of bagpipes,
I only care for news about you.
The castle keeps its secrets for love,
While I keep my memories of you.
Clearly, I'm not used to holding hands,
Yet why did I take the initiative to entwine my fingers with yours?
Your heart has too many secrets, I won't pry.
Clearly, he is gentler,
Perhaps he can give you more.
No need to choose, I'll automatically become a friend.

What kind of man:
Kissing your hand,
Still leaning against your head,
Letting you lie on my chest,
That person is no longer me.
These usual gestures,
Now they are called sadness,
Oh, sadness.
Life begins anew,
I live without you just the same,
It won't be too hard,
I will silently accept.
After all, when we were together,
Both of us had our happy moments,
That's enough.
My warmth and your indifference,
Made love fog up.
If a heart is drawn on the fogged-up window,
Is it blurred,
Or clearer?
What kind of man are you,
What kind of man,
Watching her leave without doing anything,
How naive can you be, stop pretending to be strong,
You hoped for a comeback but just let it go,
What kind of man are you,
What kind of man,
Still in love with her but not daring to ask her to wait,
It doesn't matter, continue to accept your lot,
She will meet a better man.

Confession balloon:
On the banks of the Seine, the coffee on the left bank,
I hold a cup, savoring your beauty,
Leaving a kiss on the mouth, ooh-ooh.
The rose from the flower shop, whose name was written wrong?
Love confession balloons, the wind blows them across the street,
Smiling, flying in the sky, huh, huh.
You say you're a bit hard to chase, wanting me to know when to give up,
A gift doesn't need to be the most expensive, just autumn leaves from the Champs-Elysées.
Creating a romantic date, not afraid to mess up everything,
Having you means having the whole world.
Dear, falling in love with you,
From that day, sweetness came so easily.
Dear, don't be capricious,
Your eyes are saying "I do."

Won't cry:
After we lost contact,
I heard about your life from others,
How you've been, how you're doing,
The one who couldn't let go was me.
When there were many people, I'd stay in the corner,
Afraid that someone would ask me,
What happened to you? You'd bow your head,
Protecting me, without even a complaint.
You started to avoid calls, never telling me,
You're not used to living alone.
After leaving me, you wanted me to live well,
Afraid of disturbing my desire for freedom.
Even at this time, you still cared,
What others thought of me,
Desperately explaining, it wasn't my fault,
It was you who wanted to leave.
Watching you in sorrow,
But I didn't say the words to make you stay,
You would smile and let go,
Promising not to cry as you let me go.

Yet you still cheer for my dreams,
How long have you been heartbroken,
Still finding reasons to wait for me?
